#     # CHiME-8 Leaderboard
#     In collaboration with the CHiME-8 Challenge, the NOTSOFAR team is proud to host the official leaderboard for the three tasks this year.\n
#     For details, visit:
#     1. [DASR](https://www.chimechallenge.org/current/task1/index)
#     2. [NOTSOFAR](https://www.chimechallenge.org/current/task2/index)
#     3. [MMCSG](https://www.chimechallenge.org/current/task3/index)
#
#
#     ### DASR and NOTSOFAR - the scientific story
#     Both tasks focus on distant automatic speech recognition and speaker diarization, offering a fundamental comparison
#     among different system designs:
#     - Single-channel (SC), 1 device (NOTSOFAR-SC)
#     - Multi-channel (MC), known-geometry, 1 device (NOTSOFAR-MC)
#     - Multi-channel (MC), geometry-agnostic, multiple devices (DASR-Constrained-LM and DASR-Unconstrained-LM)
#
#     Featured in both tasks, the NOTSOFAR recorded meeting dataset is leveraged as a common benchmark:
#     each geometry-agnostic MC system submitted to DASR tracks (constrained or not) will also be **automatically submitted**
#     to the known-geometry single-device NOTSOFAR-MC track. These entries will be marked with "DASR" to denote their origin.

    - *Results:* Results zip file to submit
    - *Submission track:* The track to submit results to
    - *Token:* Your Hugging Face token
    - *Description:* Short description of your submission (optional)
    
    **Hugging Face tokens:** To create a token, go to your profile settings > Access Tokens > New Token.
    Name the token and give it a write role, then copy the token and paste it in the field below.
    
    **Team creation:** Upon the first submission, your team name is associated with your Hugging Face user account.  
    Any token generated by your account can be used. All team members should use this specific user's token for 
    future submissions.
    
    **Submission limit:** 5 submissions per team every 24 hours. Each participant should only belong to one team. 
    Changing team names is allowed, but it is not intended to bypass the daily submission limit.
